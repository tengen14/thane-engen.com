        ingredients: [
          "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
          "divided ¾ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)",
          "¼ ounce Parmesan, finely grated (about ¼ cup)",
          "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves",
          "1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more",
          "8 ounces cavatappi or other short curly pasta",
          "2 ½ cups whole milk",
          "½ small onion, grated",
          "1 garlic clove, finely grated",
          "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
          "4 ounces Fontina cheese, grated (about 1 cup)",
          "4 ounces Gruyère, grated (about 1 cup)",
          "4 ounces sharp white cheddar, grated (about 1 cup)",
          "½ teaspoon English mustard powder (such as Colman’s)",
          "Pinch of cayenne pepper"
        ],
        directions: [
          "Preheat oven to 350°. Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add panko and cook, stirring, until crumbs are golden brown, 6–8 minutes (make sure to get them toasty brown; they won’t darken much during baking). Transfer to a small bowl and toss with Parmesan, thyme leaves, and ¼ tsp. salt.",
          "Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente (the noodles will continue to cook in the cheese sauce, so take them out a minute or two before you think they’re actually done). Drain pasta; let cool while you make the sauce.",
          "Bring milk to a bare simmer in a small saucepan; keep warm. Melt remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until onions are fragrant and beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to stick to bottom of saucepan, about 1 minute. Add warm milk in a few additions, whisking to combine after each addition.",
          "Bring béchamel sauce to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring, until sauce is thickened and doesn’t feel grainy when a little bit is rubbed between your fingers, 6–8 minutes (cooking the flour thoroughly at this stage ensures a creamy sauce). Add Fontina, Gruyère, cheddar, mustard powder, cayenne, and ¾ tsp. salt and stir until cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat and mix in pasta; transfer to a 2-qt. baking dish.",
          "Bake 10 minutes. Top with Parmesan breadcrumbs and bake until sauce is bubbling around the edges, 8–10 minutes longer. Let cool in pan 15 minutes before serving."
